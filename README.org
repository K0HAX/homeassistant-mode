* Introduction
This Emacs script is intended to be used with [[https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant]].
Once set up, you will be able to control your home automation system from within emacs!
* Set-up
You will have to tell your emacs where your home-assistant server is listening.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq mje/homeassistant-url "http://example.com:8123")
#+END_SRC

You will also likely want to set up a keyboard shortcut.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c s h") 'helm-homeassistant)
#+END_SRC
